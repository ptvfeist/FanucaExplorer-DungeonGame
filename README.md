# Dungeon Game - Fanuca The Explorer

// Project Description 

Our first challenge as a group, during our 4th week at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #71 Bootcamp @ Lisboa. Based on the technology we learned at this point, we were challenged to develop a game. Deadline for project deployment: 10 nights.

// The Idea 
After an initial discussion, we decided to develop a game based on the Dungeon and Dragons concept. The game concept is about a main character, who must go through hallways and other rooms, avoiding the enemies on the map and aiming to reach the treasure chest.

// Development 
We first created a sketch for the game, defining some of the business logic, the cenario and the character. Afterwards, we set the Git repository. Then we started working into the individual features of the game, assigning them for each one (sound, colision, limits, graphic elements...). The game was mainly developed in pair programming, with some parts as individual assignments.

// Tech && Methodologies 
Java, OOP, SimpleGFX Library, Git, Apache Ant
